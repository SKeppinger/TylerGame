USE THIS TEMPLATE TO CREATE ROOMS FOR ACTUAL LEVELS

EACH CHECKERBOARD SQUARE IS 400X400 PIXELS IN SIZE

OPTIMALLY, CREATE ROOMS WITH ODD DIMENSIONS IN GRID SQUARES (EG 3X3, 5X3, 3X9 ETC)
THIS IS SO THAT DOORS CAN ALWAYS BE CENTERED IF NECESSARY
3 GRID SQUARES SHOULD BE THE SMALLEST DIMENSION OF ANY ROOM

You can open the .pdn file in paint.net and create a new layer on top of the checkerboard. Outline the room on the new layer,
then select, copy and paste your outline to a new paint.net file. There, you can draw it and save it in the project as PNG.
Make sure anywhere you want the room to have a door, it mostly lines up with the straight edge of a grid square.
